# Game of Thrones (Season 1-8) Episode and Audience Analysis
![Iron Throne](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/c/ca/Iron_Throne_Official_Guide.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20220906170837) 

This project is a personal exploration of Game of Thrones using SQL and Python to analyze audience engagement and episode performance. As a fan of both the books and the show, I wanted to investigate how different episodes resonated with viewers. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) and unsupervised machine learning (clustering) to identify patterns across episodes based on metrics like U.S. viewership, ratings, and votes. Data was sourced from four Kaggle datasets and managed in DBeaver using PostgreSQL, with each table focusing on different aspects of the show. The goal is to segment episodes by how they were received and highlight trends in audience reaction over time.

### Overview
- Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on structured episode data
- Uses clustering (unsupervised ML) to segment episodes based on performance and reception
- Focuses on metrics such as U.S. viewership, episode votes, ratings, and notable events

### Tools & Technologies
- **DBeaver**: Open-source database tool for organizing and querying the data
- **PostgreSQL**: Used to manage and query data stored across 4 normalized tables
- **Python**: For data preprocessing, analysis, clustering, and visualization
- **SQL**: For initial data cleaning, aggregation, and joins

### ðŸ“¦ Data Sources
- Collected from **4 separate Kaggle datasets**
- Organized into tables covering: episodes, ratings, notable death count, etc.
- Note: Only U.S. viewership data is available; international metrics were not accessible
